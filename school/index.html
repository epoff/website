          <p>Medea loves to plan revenge on others in a deathly way. She is known for killing people to
get what she wants or to get out of trouble. She got kicked out of her hometown for
betraying her father and killing her brother. She did this because Medea wanted to help her
husband Jason collect the golden fleece so he would become king. When they get back to
his hometown, Iolcus, Jason does not become king. Medea tricks the king's daughter into
killing the king. The god's find out about what Medea did and they kick her and Jason out of
Iolcus. They go to Corinth, and have 2 sons. When Medea finds out Jason is going to marry
the princess of Corinth, she gets upset with him and they get into an argument. The king,
Creon, is now scared of Medea and wants her out of his town immediately.

          <p>This morning a witness sall Creon at Medea's house and overheard Creon say, “Medea,
sour-faced, glowering with rage against your husband: hear this. I order you now to
leave this land and go into exile, with immediate effect” (Line 18). We can infer that
Creon wants her and her kids gone and into exile immediately to protect his daughter
and the city from Medea's evil and cruel intentions.

          <br \>
          <p>When we got a hold of Creon we asked him, If he was more worried about his daughter
or city getting harmed because of Medea? Creon responded, “After my children my country is my
greatest love” (Line 21). Creon loves his country and his daughter. He wants to protect them
at all costs.

          <p>Witnesses say that the two were heard fighting all morning. Medea was also seen
outside of her house begging Creon on her hands and knees to let her stay for the sake
of her and her kids but Creon was not budging. The fear of her staying would allow her to
harm his daughter and his country.

          <p>When Medea realizes that Creon will not stand down to banishing her she asks him one
last request. Medea asks, “One day. That's all I ask. Let me stay for one more day” (Line
22). She wants to stay so she can find a place to go to. Creon understands and lets her stay
one more day. He thinks nothing will happen to his city.

          <p>As Creon leaves Medea's house, a witness overheard Medea shamelessly say, “There
are still dangers for this bride and groom, and for the happy father” (lines 23). Creon
does not know what she means by this but gets nervous because of what she has done
to people in the past.
