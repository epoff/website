            Medea likes to plan revenge on others in a deathly way. She is known for killing people to get what she wants and to get out of trouble. She got kicked out of her hometown for killing her brother. She was helping her husband collect the golden fleece so he can be the king. When they get back to his hometown, Iolcus, Jason does not become king. Medea has the king's daughter kill the king. Medea gets in trouble for this and gets her and her husband kicked out. They go to Corinth, and have 2 sons. When she finds out her husband is going to marry the princess of Corinth, she gets upset at him and they get into an argument. The king, Creon, is now scared of Medea and wants her out of his town immediately.

            When we talked to Creon he stated, “Medea, sour-faced, glowering with rage against your husband: hear this. I order you now to leave this land and go into exile, with immediate effect.” (lines 18) He wants her gone and into exile immediately. By kicking her out he hopes no more killing will happen. He also does not want to endanger his city.

            Creon wants to banish Medea from his town because he fears her. Creon nervously told Medea, “I am afraid of you, to put it bluntly; afraid that you will do some harm to my daughter.” (lines 19) Creon told her he was scared of her, making Medea shocked.

            Medea is trying to persuade Creon to let her stay for one more day and that nothing will happen. Medea wants to stay because she thinks she was protecting her family. She has two sons with Jason and Creon wants her sons to flee the country immediately. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Medea fights back and exclames “One day. That's all I ask. Let me stay for one more day.” (lines 22). She wants to stay so she finds a place to stay. Creon understands and lets her stay one more day. He thinks nothing will happen to his city.

          <p>
            As Creon leaves Madea's house she shamelessly says, “There are still dangers for this bride and groom, and for the happy father.” (lines 23) Creon does not know what she means by this but gets nervous. He soon finds out what she means.
